    <p>Objects
Various objects come towards player on the course lane, which consists of 6 columns of rails. The player is required to input corresponding commands when the object reaches the Critical Line at the bottom of the screen. The command required will differ, depending on the objects.[2]

BT Objects (for upper row of buttons)
These are white objects that come toward the player. Each BT object is one column wide.
When these objects reach the Critical Line, the player must hit the BT button corresponding to the rail where the object sits.
For chip objects, the player simply hits the buttons. For long objects, the player presses and holds the buttons until the end of the object.
FX Objects (for lower row of buttons)
These are orange objects that come toward the player. Each FX object is two columns wide.
When the objects reach the Critical Line, the player must hit the FX button corresponding to the rail where the object sits.
For chip objects, the player simply hits the buttons. For long objects, the player presses and holds the buttons until the end of the object.
From IV, there are yellow chip FX objects when being hit, a special sound effect is displayed.
Analog Device Lines (for control knobs)
These are blue and pink lines that flow from the inside to the outside of the course lane.
When the line(s) reach the Critical Line, the player must turn the corresponding analog knob(s) to make the Markers stay inside the Device line.
For sloping parts, the player must turn the knobs slowly. For right-angle parts, the player must turn the knob suddenly.
Rate systems
As the player hits the objects, a judgment is received—from highest to lowest: S-Critical, Critical, Near, and Error—depending on the timing of hitting the objects. (For long objects and Analog Devices, S-Critical and Error only.) S-Critical and Critical fills the rate gauge, while Error depletes it. (From SDVX II onward, Near also fills the gauge, but only 1/4 of the amount that S-Critical or Critical fills.) The player is required to fill the rate gauge a certain amount by the time the stage ends to clear it; otherwise the player fails it, and the play session will be over. The amount required to fill the gauge will differ, depending on the rate system the player is using.

Effective Rate
This is the default rate system. Its initial value is 0%.
The player is required to fill 70% of the rate gauge before the stage ends to clear the stage.
When playing multiplayer, if at least one player clears the stage those who fail will instead be "Saved", and they can continue the play session.
Excessive Rate
This is the rate system added in SDVX II. Its initial value is 100%.
The player is required to finish the stage without letting the rate energy fall to 0%. If the rate gauge is fully depleted before the stage ends, it's an instant failure, referred as "Track Crash".
The player receives a different clear medal when clearing a stage with this rate.
Since the player is instantly retired from the match when receiving Track Crash, the Saved system is unavailable when using this rate.
Permissive Rate
This is the rate system used in Skill Analyzer mode. Its initial value is 100%.

Blastive/Hexa Rate
Blastive Rate is the rate system used for Blaster stages and Ω (Omega) Dimension tracks while Hexa Rate is the rate system used for Hexa Diver tracks. The initial value for both are 100%.
