      <i>Still fully static, at least for now.</i>
      <p>
        The more I explore other people's blogs and websites in general, the
        stronger my desire becomes to create a minimalistic website. One that's
        centered around plain text rather than fancy animations and images that
        divert attention from the primary content of the website/blog: knowledge
        or thoughts in the form of <b>text</b>.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../IMG/bootstrap-version.png"
        alt="Previous website version with bootstrap"
      />
      <p class="image-info">A screenshot of the old desing with bootstrap</p>
      <p>
        It was a very barebones website with something like a resume at front
        and a mess everywhere else. Blog section existed only as a placeholder
        at that time.
      </p>
      <h2>Why opt for such a simple design?</h2>
      <p>
        Primarily, because I find immense pleasure in reading the thoughts and
        knowledge that individuals attempt to convey on their websites. I'm not
        in search of flashy websites built with the latest frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>
        At times, I use a more of a basic web browser that doesn't support these
        advanced features <i>(such as qutebrowser or w3m)</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of this, my aim is to craft an aesthetically pleasing website
        that prioritizes plain text, incorporating only a few subtle additions
        of images.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Why did I choose the gruvbox colorscheme and a single column design?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I really like the Gruvbox color scheme's appearance in general. I use it
        throughout my system: in the terminal, web browser, text editor, etc. So
        it's no surprise that I have decided to use it even for the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find single-column sites much more readable and approachable,
        especially when you have a lot of text presented at once. Some people
        might consider this a waste of horizontal space, but in my opinion,
        readability is more important than "efficient" screen space usage. Which
        is easier to read: text stretched across the full width of the monitor
        <i>(God forbid on an ultrawide display)</i> or a single column with a
        set width? In my view, it's always the latter. Additionally, the website
        looks essentially the same in fullscreen, tiled, and on mobile. Since I
        mostly tile my windows and rarely have just one window on the screen at
        a time, it's a pretty convenient design.
      </p>
      <h2>Blog</h2>
      <p>
        I have decided that I should finally materialize the idea of writing
        more as a means to express my discoveries or simply to enhance my
        English vocabulary and writing skills in general. It's a satisfying
        feeling when I can convey my thoughts in a concise and, hopefully,
        interesting blog post.
      </p>
      <h2>Websites that I enjoy reading</h2>
      <p>
        Altough not every one of them is static I find them very apealing and
        they are close to my principles.
      </p>

        >I'll probably expand that list in the future or create some other post
        about media that I enjoy.</i
      >
      <h2>Will I change the website in the future?</h2>
      <p>
        Certainly, the website still lacks many of the features I have in mind,
        but it's a starting point for sure. The overall look and feel of the
        site is mostly complete; I'm just making minor tweaks as I go.
