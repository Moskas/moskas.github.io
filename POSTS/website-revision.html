    <h1 class="title">Yet another website revision</h1>
    <p class="post-info">Posted on: 20.07.2023 - @Moskas</p><i>But
    still fully static, at least for now.</i>
    <p>The more I look at other people's blogs and websites in
    general the more I want to create a minimal website. That's
    focused on plain text rather than fancy animations and images
    that distract you from the main content of the website/blog,
    that is <b>text</b>.</p><img src="../IMG/bootstrap-version.png"

    <h2>Why static and no javascript?</h2>
    <p>Mainly because I really enjoy reading the thoughts and
    knowledge that people try to convey on their websites. I'm not
    looking for a flashy websites made with the latest
    frameworks.</p>
    <p>Sometimes I use a simple web browser that doesn't support
    these features (like qutebrowser). I also like to read the
    posts from a terminal via RSS reader and some people just don't
    account that some things might not be parsed correctly from the
    RSS xml.</p>
    <p>Thanks to that I would like to create a nicely looking
    website that's focused on plain text with small additions of
    images.</p>
    <h2>Why gruvbox colorscheme and single column design?</h2>
    <p>I just like how gruvboxs colors look in general. I use it
    throught my system, in terminal, webbrowser, text editor
    etc.</p>
    <p>Single column because I find it much more readable and
    approachable when you have lots of text presented at once. Some
    people might think that just a waste of a horizontal space but
    in my opinion readability is more important than efficient
    screenspace usage. Additionaly the website basically looks the
    same on fullscreen and when tilled. Since I'm mostly tilling my
    windows and rarely have one window one a screen at a time it's
    pretty convinient.</p>
    <h2>Websites that I enjoy reading</h2>
    <p>Altough not every one of them is static I find them very
    apealing and they are close to my principles.</p>
