                <h1>The growing pains</h1>
                <p>For about a year, I have been focusing on
                optimizing my computer setup with keyboard
                shortcuts for tasks such as window management,
                application launching, and text editing. It's been
                great, and I feel much better with this workflow.
                However, I'm starting to realize that my current
                keyboards aren't the best fit for my hands. As I
                try to keep my fingers on the home row, I can feel
                how cramped and unnaturally angled my wrists
                are.</p>
                <p>Additionally, at work, I used my work laptop's
                keyboard, and for a while, it was fine. But
                recently, I've been typing a lot more on it, and to
                my surprise, I've developed some wrist pains in my
                left hand in less than a week. The edge of the
                laptop must have put too much pressure on my wrist,
                leading me to switch to a far inferior cheap rubber
                dome keyboard. This change helped alleviate the
                recurring discomfort, but in exchange, the typing
                experience isn't as pleasant, and some keys are
                much harder to activate due to wear because, of
                course, it's a used keyboard that my team has used
                in temporary workstations to debug or reinstall
                operating systems.</p>
                <p>Regarding my private keyboards...</p>
                <h1>The keyboards in question</h1>
                <h2>Anne Pro 2</h2>
                <p>It's a great 60% keyboard. It's highly
                customizable with software support for Windows,
                MacOS, and Linux. Since I'm mostly using Linux
                right now, that support isn't always a given. The
                60% keyboard format is not for everyone, but for
                me, it's pretty good.</p>
                <p>The model that I have bought came with Gateron
                Blue switches, and I fell in love with the tactile
                feeling and overall clickiness of the keys. The
                lack of some keys isn't that painful since Fn1 and
                Fn2 keys exist and help with that. Moreover, since
                I'm using Vim keys for everything, even in my Emacs
                config, the absence of arrow keys isn't that
                annoying.</p>
                <p>Although when I'm using it for extended periods
                of time, I have problems keeping my fingers on the
                home row.</p>
                <h2>HyperX Alloy FPS Pro TKL</h2>
                <p>It was my first-ever mechanical keyboard. It's
                nothing special, with single-color LEDs, and the
                only on-board customizations available are LEDs.
                However, it was enough to get me hooked, and it
                helped me improve my skills in rhythm games.</p>
                <p>Currently, I'm using it exclusively for playing
                the aforementioned rhythm games, as I'm just too
                accustomed to the tactile feel of Blue
                switches.</p>
                <h1>The ideal keyboard</h1>
                <p>From my recent observations and use cases, I
                have come up with a couple of ideal points for my
                ideal keyboard:</p>
                <h2>Customization</h2>
                <p>If I have to buy a new keyboard, I don't want to
                downgrade my experience. I have customized the
                layout of my Anne Pro 2 quite a bit, especially to
                fit my window manager setup. So having the option
                to change or add keys for certain keyboard layers
                is ideal for me. Also, ideally, the software for
                customization has to be available outside of the
                Windows operating system.</p>
                <h2>Backlight</h2>
                <p>Ideally, ARGB (Addressable RGB) at least for the
                keycaps. I really like RGB lighting, even though
                everything outside my keyboard is set to a static
                color.</p>
                <h2>Portability</h2>
                <p>Lately, I have been thinking about having a
                portable setup. One that I can use when I'm at
                home, just not at my main desk, and also while
                outside, while traveling or going to a cafe, etc.
                Sometimes, I'd like to quickly write something on
                my phone, but the touchscreen keyboard isn't ideal
                for writing anything more than short responses or
                texts. I may be the weird one, but I have a fully
                working setup for writing both text and code on my
                phone, so I could edit and push changes to my
                applications on the go.</p>
                <h1>The path forward</h1>
                <p>I think I should look for some more ergonomic
                options, like split keyboards or staggered/tilted
                layouts. Especially the ergo split keyboards really
                appeal to me, but the main stopping point is their
                price, in general. Not to mention the fact that,
                due to where I live, they aren't easily available,
                and they need to be imported, so shipping costs can
                be an issue as well.</p>
                <p>Some keyboards I have taken a look at:</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>
                                <a href=
                                "https://www.keychron.com/pages/keychron-q8-customizable-mechanical-keyboard">
                                Keychron Q8</a>
                                <p>It's pretty basic, and it
                                doesn't offer any customization the
                                angle of keys. So it might be a hit
                                or miss in terms of ergonomics. The
                                best part about it is availability,
                                as I can find it in regular tech
                                shops without a problem.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <a href=
                                "https://ergodox-ez.com/">Ergodox
                                EZ</a> and <a href=
                                "https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/">Moonlander
                                Mark I</a>
                                <p>Both are quite similar and from
                                the same company. They are highly
                                customizable and work well with
                                every operating system. The main
                                difference between them is a
                                slightly different form factor and
                                the price.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <a href=
                                "https://github.com/foostan/crkbd">Corne</a>
                                <p>A pretty interesting DIY split
                                keyboard with QMK firmware. I would
                                like to build a keyboard like that
                                someday, but currently, I'm missing
                                the required soldering equipment.
                                (I really should buy a soldering
                                station after all these years).</p>
                        </li>
                </ul>
                <p>For a more complete list of split keyboards, I
                highly recommend checking out the <a href=
                "https://github.com/diimdeep/awesome-split-keyboards">
                Awesome Split Keyboards</a> repository, which
                contains many different split keyboards, both DIY
                and commercially sold models.</p>
                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>The topic of mechanical keyboards can quickly
                become a deep rabbit hole, especially when we set
                high standards and know what we want. If I ever
                experience anything more than just feeling odd with
                my hand placement or any sign of slight
                wrist/forearm pain, I will switch to some ergonomic
                option that is within my reach. But for now, I have
                to do some research.</p>
