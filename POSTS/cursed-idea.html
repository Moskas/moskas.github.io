      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Ever since I got my first e-ink reader with Android, I've been wondering
        about other uses I can find for it. One of the initial thoughts was to
        check if it supports a keyboard and mouse via a USB dongle, and it
        indeed works without any problems. So, naturally, after that, I had a
        rather stupid idea.

      <p>
        To be fair, I've done the exact same thing before with my phones, partly
        because I needed to use some Linux tools on the go to debug network
        problems at work.

      <h2>Shortcomings</h2>
      <p>
        One of the issues with my chosen device in this setup is its underlying
        hardware. Primarily, there's a lack of CPU power and a sparse amount of
        RAM. The device I'm using is the <b>Onyx Boox Leaf 2</b>, and for its
        intended purpose, it's more than sufficient. I've read many books and
        mangas on it without any issues, but the main struggle arose when I
        began setting up Emacs in Termux.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a Doom-Emacs user, I cloned the repository and launched the
        installation command. However, the tablet struggled with it because it
        had to compile some code during the installation, and due to the low
        system memory, Termux kept closing itself. Thankfully, doom-emacs is
        intelligent; it was able to pick up where it left off. So, after a
        couple of attempts, it managed to finish the installation.
      </p>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        In my opinion, the e-ink display is responsive enough for writing text
        and some code. However, I do not recommend using a mouse with it due to
        the input delay and the way the screen refreshes, which does not provide
        a good user experience. The main drawback for writing code, however, is
        the lack of syntax colors due to the black-and-white screen.
        <i
          >(At least for my model; there are some color-capable e-ink devices,
          and one day I might try using one of those.)</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Battery life also appears to be worse, which could be attributed to
        Termux being more demanding than any other application I've used, or the
        USB hub might be drawing enough power to deplete the battery much more
        quickly than before. Keeping that in mind, this setup is more of a proof
        of concept rather than an ideal workflow that would replace my laptop.
