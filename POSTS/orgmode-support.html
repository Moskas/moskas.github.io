        This will be a short post to vent some of my frustration about weird
        org-mode support on GitHub.
      </p>
      <h2>Small introduction</h2>
      <p>
        As you may or may not know, I am an Emacs user, and I write notes in
          org-mode. Even drafts for the blog are first in an org-mode file.
      </p>
      <p>
        I prefer using it over markdown wherever possible, mainly for consistency
        and additional perks of using Emacs, like code block evaluation, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently using two online git repository solutions: GitHub and
        Gitea/Forgejo (in the form of
        <a href="https://codeberg.org">codeberg.org</a>). Both of these
        solutions support org-mode, kind of.</p><p> While Gitea/Forgejo support is very
          good, and the format in my Emacs buffer and the format of <b>README.org</b> in
        the online repository look basically the same, sadly the same thing
        can't be said about GitHub.
      </p>
      <h2>GitHub...</h2>
      <p>
        GitHub has its own markdown flavor and documentation on its own wiki.
        <a
          href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax"
          >Basic writing and formatting syntax
        </a>
        wiki page.
        <p>There is no such thing for org-mode, and many elements of
            org-mode don't render correctly, like:</p>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Checkboxes They aren't rendered like markdown checkboxes; rather, they
          are represented as plain text <b>[ ]</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Header flags If you want to create a header like <b>* TODO List</b>,
          you expect it to at least render in the correct way, right? Wrong. The
          TODO part of the header disappears completely.
        </li>
        <li>
          Org-mode priority flags Org-mode has its own formatting for specifying
          the importance of a given task: <b>[#A] [#B] [#C]</b>. I know GitHub
          Markdown doesn't have such flags, so they might as well be removed
          completely too, but they aren't.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So you can imagine how broken some org-mode files can look when pushed
        to github as the main <b>README.org</b>.
