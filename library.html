          An interesting book that tells more than just about tea and teaism. It
          discusses its importance in the culture of Japan and shows the beauty
          and serenity of the tea ceremony. The book emphasizes how teaism
          taught the Japanese many things, most importantly simplicity. Kakuzo
          argues that tea-induced simplicity affected the culture, art, and
          architecture of Japan.

          A book that is a log of a <b>51 day</b> passage from Japan(Shimoda) to
          Canada(Victoria). The book is written by Rekka Bellum and Devine Lu
          Linvega aka <a href="https://100r.co/">Hundred Rabbits</a>. It's a
          great book portraying emotions and daily life on board of a small ship
          in a very harsh environment. I was fascinated by their creations for
          quite a while now so this book was a must read for me.

            A must read for all Linux users that are also interested in mangas.
            It's an old short series that tells a story about a school IT club
            that tries to spread information about Linux and FOSS (mainly Ubuntu
            but not only) inside of their school.<br />
